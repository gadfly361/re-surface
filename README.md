# Re-surface

This library is an attempt to provide structure to
a [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) application at
the **page** level (which we will be calling a `surface`).

[Demo](http://rawgit.com/gadfly361/re-surface/master/demo/index.html)

[Source](https://github.com/gadfly361/re-surface/tree/master/src/demo/re_surface)

To use re-surface, add the following to the `:dependencies` vector in your project.clj file:

```clojure
[re-surface "0.1.0-alpha3"]
```

**Note: This is very much a work in progress and subject to sweeping changes.**

# The problem

> Should this be position fixed or absolute?
> If this is position fixed, then do I need to add margin to that?
> Why isn't the z-index working ... shouldn't this be higher than that?

When I first start an application, I am excited and eager to get
going. Generally, I just start barreling forward writing clojurescript
without much concern for writing quality CSS. 

In particular, the CSS regarding the page structure is a mess. It
isn't until I am asked to add a sidebar or to make a sticky header
that I even give my CSS a real thought. However, by that time, I have
already been using some haphazard convention, and, well ...  since
there is already a lot of momentum, I just hack together something
that works. Something that will specifically add that sidebar or that
sticky header, but not something that I am proud of. You know,
when you add a lot of control flow logic or disaggregated state or
when you just close your eyes and add new classes to the bottom of an
ever-growing stylesheet and hope that no one judges you.

# Re-surface's solution

Re-surface exposes a single reagent component, `surface`, which
provides a reasonable page structure for 80% of applications.

## surface component

A `surface` takes a hash-map of the following:

| key                | type               | default     | required? |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| :app-state         | reagent.core/atom  |             | no (1)    |
| :component-registry| component-registry |             | **yes**   |
| :surface-config    | surface-config     |             | no        |
| :surface-key       | keyword            |             | **yes**   |
| :surface-registry  | surface-registry   |             | **yes**   |


(1) The `:app-state` value will get passed to the components of a
surface. This is useful if you are using vanilla reagent. However, if you are
using re-frame, you can go ahead and ignore this.

## component-registry

A component-registry is a hash-map of the following keys:

- `:header`
- `:header-dropdown`
- `:navbar`
- `:navbar-dropdown`
- `:body`
- `:footer`
- `:dimmer`
- `:sidebar-left`
- `:sidebar-right`
- `:modal`
- `:modal-fullscreen`

The value of each of these is a hash-map where:
- the key is the `:key` used in the `surface-registry`, and
- the value is a reagent-component that takes a single parameter, `app-state`.

An example component-registry could look like this:

```clojure
{:header {:default (fn [app-state]
                     [:h1 "Header"])}

 :body {:home (fn [app-state]
                [:div
                 [:h1 "This is the home page"]])

        :about (fn [app-state]
                 [:div
                  [:h1 "This is the about page"]])}}
```

## surface-registry

An example surface-registry could look like this:

```clojure
{:home-page
 {:header {:key    :default
           :height 100}

  :body {:key :home}}

 :about-page
 {:header {:key    :default
           :height 100}

  :body {:key :about}}}
```

A surface-registry is a hash-map.
- The keys are used by `surface-key` to lookup which surface to render.
- The values are a hash-map of the following:

### :header / :navbar / :footer

`:header`, `:navbar`, and `:footer` take a hash-map of the following:

| key          | type               | default     | required? |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| :background-color | string        | "white"     | no        |
| :fixed?      | boolean            | false       | no        |
| :height      | int                |             | **yes**   |
| :key         | keyword            |             | **yes**   |

- `:key` is used to lookup a component from the component-registry

### :header-dropdown / :navbar-dropdown

`:header-dropdown` and `:navbar-dropdown` take a hash-map of the following:

| key          | type               | default     | required? |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| :active?     | boolean            | false       | no        |
| :background-color | string        | "white"     | no        |
| :bottom      | int                |             | no        |
| :height      | int                |             | no        |
| :key         | keyword            |             | **yes**   |
| :left        | int                |             | no        |
| :right       | int                |             | no        |
| :top         | int                |             | no        |
| :width       | int                |             | no        |

### :body

`:body` takes a hash-map of the following:

| key          | type               | default     | required? |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| :background-color | string        | "white"     | no        |
| :key         | keyword            |             | **yes**   |


### :dimmer

`:dimmer` takes a hash-map of the following:

| key          | type               | default     | required? |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| :key         | keyword            |             | **yes**   |

### :sidebar-left / :sidebar-right

`:sidebar-left` and `:sidebar-right` take a hash-map of the following:

|--------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| :active?     | boolean            | false       | no        |
| :background-color | string        | "white"     | no        |
| :fixed?      | boolean            | false       | no        |
| :key         | keyword            |             | **yes**   |
| :width       | int                |             | **yes**   |


### :modal

`:modal` takes a hash-map of the following:

| key          | type               | default     | required?  |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|------------|
| :active?     | boolean            | false       | no         |
| :background-color | string        | "white"     | no         |
| :height      | int                |             | **yes**    |
| :key         | keyword            |             | **yes**    |
| :width       | int                |             | **yes**    |

### :modal-fullscreen

`:modal-fullscreen` takes a hash-map of the following:

| key          | type               | default     | required?  |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|------------|
| :active?     | boolean            | false       | no         |
| :background-color | string        | "white"     | no         |

|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| :debug?          | boolean                        | false       | no         |

| :z-indicies      | z-indicies                     |             | no         |

- `:debug?` can be used if you'd like to see a background color on each of the elements during development. This was used when creating the demo.
- `:spec?` can be used to turn on/off cljs.spec assertions.
- `:style-component` really **shouldn't** be used. This is an escape-hatch to override the CSS provided by re-surface if you absolutely needed to.
- `:z-indicies` really **shouldn't** be used. This is an escape-hatch to override the z-indicies used for each element.

# What's next?

The following things are on my mind:

- notifications
- snackbar / toast
